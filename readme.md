The objective of the game is to grow a Blobit, a circular player-controlled object, by swallowing both pellets and smaller Blobits without being swallowed by bigger Blobits. It can be played between teams. There is no set goal; players restart when all of their Blobits are swallowed.

The game contains three entities: pellets, blobits and viruses:

Pellets, or food, are randomly scattered among the map. When swallowed, they slightly increase a Blobits mass.

Blobits are controlled by players. Only opponent Blobits that are smaller can be swallowed; they can be swallowed directly, or by splitting, as described below. Blobits move slower with heavier mass and gradually lose mass over time.

Viruses split larger Blobits into many pieces. Smaller Blobits can hide behind them for protection against larger Blobits. They can be fed to create another virus launched at a direction the player chooses.

Players can split a part of their Blobit, flinging one of the divided Blobits at the direction of the cursor. This can be used as a ranged attack to swallow other Blobits, to escape from a difficult situation, or to move more quickly around the map. Split Blobits eventually merge into one. Players can also release a small fraction of their mass to grow other cells or to feed viruses, which splits them when done several times.
